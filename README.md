This was an old roblox exploit UI me and my friend were making back in 2018. This was before monaco was a thing (wow, i know right), either way its pretty much junk code at this point so why not release? Do note, i do not exploit anymore because its a waste of time and is boring. There are some people on roblox that are legit braindead enough to spend almost 20+ hours a week on something like "Adopt Me"

More info - This was like my third exploit i made after NEX and NIGHT, both of which were meh. Night tho did get me like $25 total through its lifetime however so i will say big epic. Not sure if I really want to release night's source. I mean, its a really hefty source, and i guarantee a lot of people want it.. so i might decide to release it in about half a year xD
