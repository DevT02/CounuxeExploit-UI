This was an old roblox exploit UI me and my friend were making back in 2018. This was before monaco was a thing (wow, i know right), either way its pretty much junk code at this point so why not release? Do note, i do not exploit anymore because its a waste of time and is boring. 

More info - This was like my third exploit i made after NEX and NIGHT, both of which were meh. Night tho did get me like $50 total through its lifetime however so i will say big epic. Not sure if I really want to release night's source.
