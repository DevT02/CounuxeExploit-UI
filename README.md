jk it sucks roblox is for nerds

This was an old roblox exploit UI me and my friend were making back in 2018. This was before monaco was a thing (wow, i know right), either way its pretty much junk code at this point so why not release? If you just found this and you are actually enjoying it, why not head on over to https://v3rmillion.net? I mean, that site is basically for you. Do note, i do not exploit anymore because its a waste of time and is boring. Especially on a game made for 5-year-olds. 

There are some people on there that are legit braindead enough to spend almost 20+ hours a week on something like "Adopt Me" LOL
